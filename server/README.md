# Batch 103 final project

We will be doing a food delivery application for our final project. It will be a challenge but it will also be a huge learning curve 💪🏾

The project will consist of the following features:

### Features for Users

- **Sign in** - For registration in the application.
- **Log in** - For registered users to access their accounts.
- **List of restaurants** - To offer a choice or list of restaurants.
- **Menu**- To enable access to the food list. This feature is integrated with each store page separately.
- **Cart**- To add, remove, and view products before purchase.
- **Order history**- To see and check the previously placed orders and activity log.
- **Multiple filters**- To help users search by location, price and name.

### Features for Restaurants

- **Dashboard**- Shows order status like order preparation, completion, cancellation.
- **Accept / Reject order**- With this feature, food service manages accept and reject orders.
- **Store / restaurant profile**- To showcase the menu, update and delete dishes, manage the details in the description.
